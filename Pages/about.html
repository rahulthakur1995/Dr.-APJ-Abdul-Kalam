            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam Bharat Ratna</b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) 
                was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th 
                president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, 
                Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next 
                four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence 
                Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation 
                (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military 
                missile development efforts.</p> <p> He thus came to be known as the <i>Missile Man of India</i> 
                for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                </p> <p>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in 
                India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test
                by India in 1974.</p><p>Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with 
                the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian 
                National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",</p> <p>He returned to
                his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. 
                He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna,
                India's highest civilian honour.While delivering a lecture at the Indian 
                Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent 
                cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.</p> <p>Thousands, including national-level
                dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, 
                where he was buried with full state honours.</p>

        <div>
            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family
                in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency 
                and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner 
                and imam of a local mosque;</p>
                <p>His mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a ferry that 
                took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited 
                Dhanushkodi.</p>
                <p>Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.</p>
                <p>His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous 
                properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
                in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local
                women. The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland 
                and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between 
                the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland 
                in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties 
                were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was 
                poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had 
                to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>
                <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a 
                bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He 
                spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.</p>
                <p>After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, 
                Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, 
                from where he graduated in physics in 1954.</p>
                <p>He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras
                Institute of Technology.</p>
                <p>While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was 
                dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his 
                scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days.
                Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet 
                a difficult deadline.</p>
                <p>He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a 
                fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers,
                and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
            <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology 
                in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment
                of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press
                Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after 
                becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS).
                He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, 
                but remained unconvinced 
                by his choice of a job at DRDO.</p>
                <p>Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was
                interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy,
                the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching
                Station (TERLS).</p>
                <p>In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space 
                Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project 
                director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle 
                (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite
                in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started
                work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO 
                in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's 
                approval and expanded the programme to include more
                engineers.</p>
                <p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley 
                Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space 
                Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops 
                Flight Facility.</p>
                <p>Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to 
                develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) 
                and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be 
                successful.</p>
                <p>Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to 
                witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling 
                Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though
                he had not participated in its development. 
                In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, 
                Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought 
                to develop ballistic missiles from the technology 
                of the successful SLV programme.</p>
                <p>Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet,
                Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for 
                these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers
                under Kalam's directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral 
                role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature
                of these classified aerospace projects.</p>
                <p>His research and educational leadership brought 
                him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s,
                which prompted the government 
                to initiate an advanced missile programme 
                under his directorship.</p>
                <p>Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist 
                and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, 
                worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, 
                R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development 
                of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles 
                one after another.<p>R Venkatraman was instrumental in 
                getting the cabinet approval for allocating â‚¹ 3.88 billion 
                for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development 
                Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.</p> 
                <p>Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under 
                the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic 
                missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, 
                although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and 
                cost and time overruns.</p>
                <p>Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the 
                Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research 
                and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 
                1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during 
                this period in which he played an intensive political and 
                technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, 
                along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase.</p>
                <p>Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's 
                best known nuclear scientist.</p>
                <p>However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam, 
                said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a 
                "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report</p>
                <p>Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims</p>
                <p>In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a 
                low cost coronary stent, named the "Kalam-Raju Stent".</p>
                <p>In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in 
                rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Presidency</h3>
            <p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding 
            K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with 
            an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes 
            won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002, 
            to 25 July 2007.</p>
            <p>On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which 
            was in power at the time, expressed that they would
            nominate Kalam for the post of President,</p>
            <p>Both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist 
            Congress Party backed his candidacy</p>
            <p>After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, 
            Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving 
            the field clear.[44] Kalam said of the 
            announcement of his candidature:
            <blockquote> <i>I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet 
            and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was 
            thinking what message I can give to the people of the country 
            at this juncture.</i></blockquote></p>
            <p>On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination 
            papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied 
            by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.</p>
            <p>The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 
            2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with 
            the media claiming that the election was a one-sided 
            affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; 
            the count was held on 18 July</p>
            <p>Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,
            and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in 
            on 25 July.Kalam was the third President of India to have 
            been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, 
            before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir 
            Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became 
            the President of India. He was also the first scientist and the first 
            bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.</p>
            <p>During his term as president, he was affectionately 
            known as the People's President, saying that 
            signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision 
            he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was 
            criticised for his inaction in deciding the fate of 20 
            out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during 
            his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution of India 
            empowers the President of India to grant pardons, 
            and suspend or commute the death sentence of 
            convicts on death row.</p>
            <p>Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure 
            as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, 
            who was later hanged.] Perhaps the most notable plea was from 
            Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy 
            in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was 
            sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.
            While the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 
            2006, the pending action on his mercy plea resulted in him remaining 
            on death row. He also took the controversial decision to impose 
            President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.</p>
            <p>In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, 
            Kalam supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping 
            in view the population of the country.</p>
            <p>At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, 
            Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a 
            second term in office provided there was certainty 
            about his victory in the 2007 presidential election.
             However, two days later, he decided not to 
            contest the Presidential election again stating 
            that he wanted to avoid involving Rashtrapati 
            Bhavan from any political processes. He was 
            proposed by third front named United National 
            Progressive Alliance leader J. Jayalalithaa and 
            coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav 
            and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the support of the 
            left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a 
            renewed mandate.</p>
            <p>Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil 
            on 24 July 2012, media reports in April claimed that Kalam was likely 
            to be nominated for his second term. After the reports, 
            social networking sites witnessed a number of people supporting his 
            candidature. The BJP potentially backed his nomination[failed verification], 
            saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi 
            Party and Indian National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election.
             A month ahead of the election, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also 
            expressed their support for Kalam. Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav backed out, 
            leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter. On 18 June 2012, 
            Kalam declined to contest the 2012 presidential poll. 
            He said of his decision not to do so:
                <blockquote><i>Many, many citizens have also expressed the same wish. 
                It only reflects their love and affection for me and the aspiration of the
                people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, 
                I respect it. I want to thank them for the trust they 
                have in me.</i></blockquote></p>

            <h3>Post-presidency</h3>
            <p>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at 
            the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, 
            the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, 
            and the Indian Institute of Management Indore; 
            an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, 
            Bangalore; chancellor of the Indian Institute of 
            Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram; professor of

            <p>In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam 
            Nuclear Power Plant; he supported the establishment of the nuclear 
            power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people.
            The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a 
            pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided 
            regarding the safety features of the plant.</p>
            <p>In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme for the youth of India called 
            the What Can I Give Movement, with a central theme of defeating corruption.</p>
