        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of 
        whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (1997), followed by three elder 
        brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 â€“ 7 March 2021),
        Mustafa Kalam (1999) and Kasim Mohammed (1995).
        He was extremely close to his elder siblings and their extended families 
        throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his 
        older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.</p>
        <p>Kalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. 
        He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 
        7 a.m. and sleeping by 2 a.m.[126] His few personal possessions included 
        his books, his veena, some articles of clothing, a CD player and a laptop; 
        at his death, he left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother, 
        who survived him.</p>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a 
        lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian 
        Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, 
        he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium 
        after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his 
        lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital 
        in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs 
        of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed 
        dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, 
        to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
        <p>Following his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force 
        helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on 
        the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at 
        Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the President, the vice-president, 
        the Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service 
        chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was 
        then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence 
        at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including 
        former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president 
        Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.</p>
        <p>On the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, 
        was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J 
        aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received 
        at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, 
        including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan 
        and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. 
        After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town 
        of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. 
        Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the 
        local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8 p.m. that evening.</p>
        <p>On 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei 
        Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the 
        last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the 
        chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
        <h4>Reactions</h4>
        <p>India reacted to Kalam's death with an outpouring of 
            grief; numerous tributes were paid to the former president across 
            the nation and on social media. The Government of India declared 
            a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect. President 
            Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, 
            and other leaders condoled the former President's demise. Prime Minister 
            Narendra Modi said "Kalam's death is a great loss to the scientific 
            community. He took India to great heights. He showed the way." Former
            Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, 
            said, "our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions 
            to the promotion of self-reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely 
            with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president 
            of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations to come."
            ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague 
            "a great personality and a gentleman", while former chairman G. Madhavan 
            Nair described Kalam as "a global leader" for whom "the downtrodden and poor 
            people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind 
            to the young generation", adding that his death left a 
            vacuum which none could fill.</p>
            <p>South Asian leaders expressed condolences and lauded the late 
            statesman. The Bhutanese government ordered the country's flags to 
            fly at half-staff to mourn Kalam's death and lit 1000 butter lamps 
            in homage. Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay expressed deep 
            sadness, saying Kalam "was a leader greatly admired by all people, 
            especially the youth of India who have referred to him as the people's 
            President". Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam 
            as "a rare combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a 
            source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia" and termed 
            his death an "irreparable loss to India and beyond". 
            Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said "as a nuclear scientist, 
            he engaged himself in the welfare of the people". Ashraf Ghani, 
            the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam "an inspirational figure 
            to millions of people," noting that "we have a lot to learn from his 
            life". Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scientific 
            contributions to India: "Nepal has lost a good friend and I have lost an 
            honoured and ideal personality." The President of Pakistan, 
            Mamnoon Hussain, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif 
            also expressed their grief and condolences on his death. 
            The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, 
            also expressed his condolences. "Dr. Kalam was a man of firm conviction and 
            indomitable spirit, and I saw him as an outstanding statesman of the world. 
            His death is an irreparable loss not only to India but to the entire world." 
            Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen and Vice-president Ahmed Adeeb condoled 
            Kalam's death, with Yameen naming him as a close friend of the Maldives who 
            would continue to be an inspiration to Indians and generations of South Asians. 
            Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had made an official visit to 
            India during Kalam's presidency, termed his demise as a great loss to all of 
            humankind. The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior 
            General Min Aung Hlaing, expressed condolences on behalf of the Myanmar 
            government. The Dalai Lama expressed his sadness and offered condolences 
            and prayers, calling Kalam's death "an irreparable loss".</p>
            <p>Kathleen Wynne, the Premier of Ontario, which Kalam had visited on numerous 
            occasions, expressed "deepest condolences ... as a respected scientist, 
            he played a critical role in the development of the Indian space programme. 
            As a committed educator, he inspired millions of young people to achieve their 
            very best. And as a devoted leader, he gained support both at home and abroad, 
            becoming known as 'the people's President'. I join our Indoâ€“Canadian families, 
            friends, and neighbours in mourning the passing of this respected leader." 
            United States President Barack Obama extended "deepest condolences to the 
            people of India on the passing of former Indian President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam", 
            and highlighted his achievements as a scientist and as a statesman, notably his 
            role in strengthening USâ€“India relations and increasing space co-operation between 
            the two nations. "Suitably named 'the People's President', Dr. Kalam's humility and 
            dedication to public service served as an inspiration to millions of Indians and 
            admirers around the world." Russian President Vladimir Putin expressed sincere 
            condolences and conveyed his sympathy and support "to the near and dear ones of the 
            deceased leader, to the government, and entire people of India". He remarked on Kalam's 
            outstanding "personal contribution to the social, economic, scientific, and technical 
            progress of India and in ensuring its national security," adding that Kalam would be 
            remembered as a "consistent exponent of closer friendly relations between our nations, 
            who has done a lot for cementing mutually beneficial Russianâ€“Indian cooperation."
            Other international leadersâ€”including former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, 
            Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President 
            of the United Arab Emirates Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and vice-president and Prime 
            Minister of the United Arab Emirates and emir of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed 
            bin Rashid Al Maktoumâ€”also paid tribute to Kalam. In 
            a special gesture, Secretary-General of 
            the United Nations Ban Ki-moon visited the Permanent Mission of India to the 
            UN and signed a condolence book. "The outpouring of grief around the world is 
            a testament of the respect and inspiration he has garnered during and after his
            presidency. The UN joins the people of India in sending our deepest condolences 
            for this great statesman. May he rest in peace and eternity", 
            Ban wrote in his message.</p>
            <h4>Memorial</h4>
            <p>The Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial 
                was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu, 
                in the island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. It was inaugurated 
                by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July 2017. On display 
                are the replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with. 
                Acrylic paintings about his life are also displayed along with hundreds 
                of portraits depicting the life of the mass leader. There is a statue of 
                Kalam in the entrance showing him playing the Veena. There are two 
                other smaller statues of the leader in sitting and standing posture.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Religious and spiritual views</h3>
        <p>Religion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his 
            life. He made his own spiritual journey the subject of his final book,</p>
        <h4>Islam</h4>
        <p>A proud and practising Sunni Muslim, daily namaz and 
        fasting during Ramadan were integral to Kalam's life.
        His father, the imam of a mosque in his hometown of 
        Rameswaram, had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children.
        [9] His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith 
        respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: "Every evening, my father A. P. Jainulabdeen, 
        an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, 
        and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the 
        island." Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's 
        multitudinous issues lay in "dialogue and cooperation" among the country's religious, 
        social, and political leaders. Moreover, since Kalam believed that "respect for 
        other faiths" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, he was fond of saying: 
        "For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make 
        religion a fighting tool.</p>
        <h4>Syncretism</h4>
        <p>One component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in 
        India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he 
        embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and 
        cultural traditions of India. In addition to his faith 
        in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions; 
        he learnt Sanskrit, read the Bhagavad Gita and he was a 
        vegetarian. Kalam also enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena 
        (an Indian string instrument), and listening to Carnatic devotional music 
        every day. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming 
        president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating 
        that "during the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of 
        all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing 
        about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country".
        Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Congress leader Shashi 
        Tharoor stated, "Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism 
        of India's heritage of diversity". BJP leader L. K. Advani concurred that 
        Kalam was "the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of 
        all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense 
        diversity. This was most strikingly evident in the second-to-last book he published, 
        presciently titled Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swami".</p>
        <h4>Pramukh Swami as Guru</h4>
        <p>Kalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders to help create a more 
        prosperous, spiritual, and unified India was what initially led him to 
        meet Pramukh Swami, the Hindu guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, 
        who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru.
        The first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami over 
        a fourteen-year period took place on 30 June 2001, in New Delhi, during which 
        Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and 
        spiritual purity. Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami 
        throughout their numerous interactions. One such incident occurred the day 
        following the terrorist attack on BAPS' Akshardham, Gandhinagar complex in 
        September 2002; Pramukh Swami prayed for, and sprinkled holy water upon, the 
        sites of all of the deceased, including the terrorists, demonstrating the view 
        that all human life is sacred. Kalam recalled being moved by Pramukh Swami's 
        equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for 
        writing Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji. 
        Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that 
        "[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of 
        the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a 
        God-synchronous orbit. No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am 
        placed in my final position in eternity." Following Kalam's 
        death a month after his final book was released, co-author Arun Tiwari 
        pointed to this passage as potentially prophetic and 
        premonitory of Kalam's death.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Writings</h3>
        <p>In his book India 2020, Kalam strongly advocated an action plan 
        to develop India into a "knowledge superpower" and a developed nation by 2020. 
        He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert 
        India's place as a future superpower.
        <blockquote><i>I have identified five areas where India has a core competence 
        for integrated action: (1) agriculture and food processing; 
        (2) education and healthcare; (3) information and communication 
        technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power, 
        surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country; and 
        (5) self-reliance in critical technologies. These five areas are closely 
        inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will lead to food, 
        economic and national security.</i></blockquote></p>
        <p>Kalam describes a "transformative moment" in his life when he asked 
        Pramukh Swami, the guru of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya, 
        how India might realise this five-pronged vision of development.  
        Pramukh Swami's answerâ€”to add a sixth area developing faith in God and 
        spirituality to overcome the current climate of crime and corruptionâ€”became 
        the spiritual vision for the next 15 years Kalam's life, which he describes 
        in his final book, Transcendence: My Spiritual Experiences with Pramukh Swamiji, 
        published just a month before his death.</p>
        <p>It was reported that there was considerable demand in South Korea for translated 
        versions of books authored by him.</p>
        <p>Kalam took an active interest in other developments in the 
        ield of science and technology, including a research programme 
        for developing biomedical implants. He also supported open source 
        technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of 
        free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of information 
        technology to more people.</p>
        <p>Kalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students 
        during the two years after his resignation from the post of 
        scientific adviser in 1999. He explained, "I feel comfortable in 
        the company of young people, particularly high school students. 
        Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping them 
        to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a 
        developed India for which the road map is already available." His dream 
        is to let every student to light up the sky with victory using their latent 
        fire in the heart.</p>
